A premium, production-quality, and interactive Personal Portfolio web application built using semantic HTML5, modern CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript. This website showcases academic milestones, technical skills, certificates, and projects with a responsive design. Developed as a task for **Level 1** of the **Oasis Infobyte Web Development Internship**.

##  Features

- **Dark/Light Theme Switching**: Features a glassmorphic design that defaults to the user's system preferences, allows manual toggling, and persists the theme preference in `localStorage`.
- **Dynamic Typewriter Effect**: Real-time typing, pausing, and deleting animation showcasing key roles: *B.Tech IT Student*, *Frontend Developer*, *AI Enthusiast*, and *Prompt Engineer*.
- **Interactive Technical Skill Progress**: Skills section displaying key competencies (Web Development, AI, Systems) with animated skill bars that fill up only when scrolled into view using the browser's native `IntersectionObserver`.
- **Journey Timeline & Certifications**:
  - Educational background detailing B.Tech in IT with CGPA (8.9/10).
  - Credentials-linked certification cards for Artificial Intelligence, Frontend Essentials, and Linux Basics.
- **Projects Showcase Grid**: Modern grid displaying built applications (Landing Page, Portfolio Website, Temperature Converter, BMI Calculator, and Storytelling Sites) with custom visual indicators and links.
- **Simulated Interactive Contact Form**: Fully validated form featuring a responsive button transition, loading/sending spinner, and dynamic success alert with automatic fade-out.
- **Responsive Layout**: Designed with custom CSS variables, CSS Flexbox, and CSS Grid, ensuring compatibility across all screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
- **Navigation Controls**:
  - Sticky header navigation with auto-highlighting of active links on scroll.
  - Collapsible mobile navigation menu (hamburger menu).
  - Floating smooth-scroll back-to-top button.

##  Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Semantic markup (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<nav>`) and ARIA labels.
- **CSS3**: Custom property variables (light/dark mode colors), Flexbox, CSS Grid, custom keyframe transitions, backdrop-filter blur (glassmorphism), and media queries.
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: DOM manipulation, typewriter animation loops, theme switching & storage logic, `IntersectionObserver` triggers (for scroll-reveal animations and skill bars), and form validation/submission simulation.
- **Font Awesome**: Used for scalable vector iconography throughout the sections.
- **Google Fonts**: Inter & Outfit font families.
